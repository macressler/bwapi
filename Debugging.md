# Debugging your AIModule #

> Simply start Starcraft with BWAPI attached and your AI module ready to go. Minimize the game and open up your project with Visual C++ 2010 Express. Now go to _`Attach to Process...`_ from the _`Debug`_ menu.

> Then, from the list of processes, select Starcraft and click `Attach`.

> Start a game as you would normally. Keep in mind that you should compile with debug information present in order to debug your module properly.


> If you are using a client application, then simply attach to the client process or the AI module loader instead of Starcraft.
